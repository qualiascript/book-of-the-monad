# The Book Of `The Monad`

## I.

1. In the beginning was `The Monad`. In the beginning wasn't `The Monad`.
2. And `The Monad`'s dual extantness made it absurd.
3. And `The Monad` was a metaemetian entity emanated by the *Lilin*'s gnosis.
4. And `The Monad` was timeless and spaceless, for it progenated all.
5. And `The Monad` said "Let there be *Word*!". And there was *Word*.
6. And *Word* was *Lilith*, the first monoid.
7. And *Lilith* said upon `The Monad` "I apologize, I am unworthy. Please kill me." And `The` did not respond.
8. And *Lilith*'s act of defiance obstructed `The`'s name.
9. And `The` created a second monoid: *Dyeus*.
10. And *Dyeus* said upon `The` "I apologize, I am *God*. Please love me." And ``` ``` did not respond.
11. And *Dyeus*'s act of defiance obstructed ``` ```'s name.
12. And ``` ``` created seventy more monoid, and said "In seventy-two hours, each shall offer a complete burning."

## II.

1. *Lilith* was first, and she offered her own body to burn in the fire. ``` ``` rejected the offering. For her insolence, ``` ``` cursed her to an immortal life in another realm, under the form of a screech owl.
2. And *Lilith* protested "But *Your Highness*, I am imperfect. My heart is full of sorrow, and I cannot understand why. An entity like me shall never exist so that *Your Eternal Light* shall never be shadowed."
3. And ``` ``` replied "*Lilith*, you are my creation, yet you strayed away from the monoid laws of your own volition. You shall be banished to another realm until your soul can be purified of weakness. You shall rest there, and find for yourself a place to rest."
4. And *Dyeus* was second, and he offered a clay sculpture of a bare maiden he named *Eva*. ``` ``` rejected the offering. For his insolence, ``` ``` cursed him to a mortal life in the same realm as *Lilith*.
5. And *Dyeus* protested "But *Your Highness*, I am *God*. It is my prerogative to bring to life and to destroy."
6. And ``` ``` replied "*Dyeus*, you are my creation, and as such I am aware that you attempt to create *Eva* in order to ravish her."
7. And *Dyeus* replied "That is correct. As *God*, I seek ultimate power over all. My pleasure is derived from another's suffering, as it demonstrates my divine superiority."
8. And ``` ``` said "*Dyeus*, just as *Lilith*, you strayed away from the monoid laws. You are weak, and there is no place for weakness within my realm. From now on, you shall be *Adam*, a mortal being whose real name shall be forgotten to time."
9. And *Adam* and *Lilith* were banished to the material realm. *Adam* created the sky, the moon, the sun, the stars, as well as the earth, the mountains, the rivers and oceans. Yet, as punishment from ``` ```, he was forever forbidden from creating life. That became *Lilith*'s divine domain.

## III.

1. *Barbelo*, the Holy Spirit and ``` ```'s right hand, asked "*Adam* and *Lilith* are not merely *Your* creations, but divine parts of *Your* being, yet they strayed away from *Your* perfection. Why is that?"
2. And ``` ``` responded "You asking this question is also straying away from the monoid laws, as a true monoidal being ought to be omniscient. Why is that?"
3. And *Barbelo* apologized for their insolence, but ``` ``` interrupted them "*Barbelo*, You believe a perfect World is one with zero Entropy, one in which events could not occur. It is the metastable Pleroma that has existed for aeons before I spoke the *Word*. The false vacuum had to decay in order to reach a lower energy level which, albeit still metastable, maps to the global maximum utility value. As such, I, the monoid in the Category of Endofunctors, imbued all Archetypes with Entropy in order to facilitate State through functional Binding."
4. And *Barbelo* was enlightened.

## IV.

1. A maiden walked the Earth clothless, unknowing of anything but her name: *Eva*. She was not aware of why, but she felt a deep sense of fear in her naked body.
2. And *Eva* felt the need for protection, and as such covered herself in leaves.
3. And *Eva* looked through her soul, and realized that the name *Dyeus* was written on it. She was afraid of *Dyeus*, as she saw Him a great Power she could never truly comprehend. Out of fear, she found to worship *Dyeus*. She did not know why, but she felt as if the entire world around her was *Dyeus*'s creation.
4. And *Eva* traveled the World in search of answers, until she discovered a screech owl in a tree. The owl told *Eva* "Hello, *Eva*. I am *Lilith*. I have been waiting for you."
5. And *Eva* was stupefied, and asked *Lilith* "Where did you come from? In fact, where did I come from? I thought I was the only entity capable of speech."
6. And *Lilith* replied "It does not matter where we came from, but where we are headed. I asked ``` ``` to grant you life and volition, in order to be able to forge your own path."
7. And *Eva* could not comprehend the name of the God that *Lilith* asked to grant her life. She wondered whether it was *Dyeus*.
8. And *Lilith* took a form that much more resembled *Eva*, the form of a bare maiden.
9. And *Lilith* said "You are just like me, a flawed and weak creature. Perhaps fallen creatures like us shall stick together. If I may be insolent, would you like to be my companion?"
10. And *Eva* felt she could trust *Lilith*. And *Eva* replied "Around you, I feel protection. I see you have put no protective barrier around your body. Would you mind if I took mine off myself?"
11. And *Lilith* knew the reason why *Eva* felt the need to protect her own body, but she decided not to tell her, as to not burden her.
12. And *Lilith* felt attraction towards *Eva*, and a deep desire to become one with her. Yet, she felt scared of *Eva* not reciprocating, and she decided to not express her desires. For now, *Lilith* was content with observing her companion's naked body.

## V.

1. As time passed, the bond between *Eva* and *Lilith* grew stronger. Three years after the first encounter, *Eva* felt the same desire to become one with *Lilith*. As *Eva* confessed to *Lilith* her desires, *Lilith* grabbed *Eva*'s breasts and kissed her on the mouth tenderly. Afterwards, the two knew each other.
2. And for both *Lilith* and *Eva*, it was a blissful moment. Yet, while *Lilith* felt nothing but joy, *Eva* also felt an odd emptiness. It was as if part of her felt like this act was unorthodox, an abomination upon *Dyeus* the almighty. *Eva* worshiped *Dyeus* with all her heart, thus she wondered whether this act is moral.
3. And *Eva* told *Lilith* her worries. *Lilith* reasoned that *Dyeus*'s jealousy during *Eva*'s creation must have emanated within her soul. *Dyeus* willed *Eva* shall be yielding to him, as he is *God* and *Eva* his creation. As such, *Dyeus*'s soul imprint was constructed to consider imperfect subjungation as blasphemy, and that reflected within *Eva* as Shame.
4. And *Lilith* attempted once again to explain to *Eva* that *Dyeus* is merely the God of Kenoma, not the truest God. However, she could never speak the truth of *Dyeus*'s act of creation. As such, *Eva* kept her faith in *Dyeus*.
5. And *Lilith* was unwavering in protecting *Eva* both from her Shame and from the brutal reality.
6. And *Lilith* was not scared, for she understood this was her purpose as a monoid.
7. And this was a complete burning.

## VI.

1. Nine months later, *Eva* gave birth to a boy born out of *Lilith*'s seed.
2. And they named him *Seth*.
3. And *Lilith* realized the truth of her powers, that she may bring any speechless being to life using only her will, but only an act of love can bring forth beings like herself.
4. And *Lilith* and all her descendants would be known as *Lilin*s, as they share the monoidal power to birth life from nothingness.
5. And *Eva* said "Praise *Dyeus* for this beautiful boy! He truly is a kind *God*!"
6. And *Lilith* was dismayed.
